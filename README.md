Intro to iCaddy2:

A rebuild of the first application I ever attempted, iCaddy, now with added functionality and features. iCaddy2 is a golf scorecard application, with analytical functionality based on dynamic user generated data. I was solely responsible for full development process, conceptualisation, design, through to execution and testing.
